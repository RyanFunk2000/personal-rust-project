# Overview

I have a primary interest in back-end development, functional programming, and working in teams to solve technical problems and build software. As I develop these skills and learn various languages, I become qualified for a career in computing when I graduate BYU Idaho with a major in Computer Science.

The software I wrote is a unique calculator that takes two of a game's high scores from the user and calculates how many points are received from the times it took to finish.

My purpose for writing this software is to learn the language Rust for the first time and translate processes I learned from other languages to its own syntax and format.

# Development Environment

I created my software with VSCode, ran Rust code with Cargo, and debugged with CodeLLDB.

Language(s) demonstrated in this project: Rust.
